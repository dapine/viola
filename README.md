# viola

viola is an experimental subtitles editor with a simple UI and subtitles styling.

## Installation
Tested in Linux and Windows. At the moment there is no release packages, so should be built with `npm` manually. You need the latest stable version of `npm` and `node.js`. Download or clone this repo then `cd` into the directory and run the following command:

```
npm run electron-pack
```

## Note to users
This is a very early experimental project. Things will likely change or break, so do not expect a serious development cycle and author's commitment.
